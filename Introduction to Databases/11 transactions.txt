# Transactions:

	A transaction symbolizes a unit of work performed within a database management system (or similar system) against a database,
	and treated in a coherent and reliable way independent of other transactions. A transaction generally represents any change in database.
	Transactions in a database environment have two main purposes:
	
	To provide reliable units of work that allow correct recovery from failures and keep a database consistent even in cases of system failure,
	when execution stops (completely or partially) and many operations upon a database remain uncompleted, with unclear status.

	To provide isolation between programs accessing a database concurrently. If this isolation is not provided, the program's outcome are possibly erroneous.
	A database transaction, by definition, must be atomic, consistent, isolated and durable.
	Database practitioners often refer to these properties of database transactions using the acronym ACID.

# ACID transaction:

	ACID is a set of properties that you would like to apply when modifying a database.

	-Atomicity
	-Consistency
	-Isolation
	-Durability

	A transaction is a set of related changes which is used to achieve some of the ACID properties.
	Transactions are tools to achieve the ACID properties.

# Transaction log:

	Every SQL Server database has a transaction log that records all transactions and the database modifications made by each transaction. 
	The transaction log must be truncated on a regular basis to keep it from filling up. 
	However, some factors can delay log truncation, so monitoring log size is important. 
	Some operations can be minimally logged to reduce their impact on transaction log size.
	The transaction log is a critical component of the database and, if there is a system failure,
	the transaction log might be required to bring your database back to a consistent state. 
	The transaction log should never be deleted or moved unless you fully understand the ramifications of doing this.
