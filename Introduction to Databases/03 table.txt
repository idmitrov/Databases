#TABLE:

Organizes the information about a single topic into rows and columns.

For example, a database for a business would typically contain a table for customer information,
which would store customers' account numbers, addresses, phone numbers, and so on as a series of columns. 
Each single piece of data (such as the account number) is a field in the table. 
A column consists of all the entries in a single field, such as the telephone numbers of all the customers. 
Fields, in turn, are organized as records, which are complete sets of information 
(such as the set of information about a particular customer), each of which comprises a row.
The process of normalization determines how data will be most effectively organized into tables.

#DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TABLE AND RELATION:

Relation does not have any explicit ordering and cannot have duplicates.  
While a table is a representation of a relation, 
it is an imperfect one unless there is a unique key constraint (otherwise it has duplicates).
