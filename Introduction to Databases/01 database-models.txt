# Relational model

	The relational model is the best known and in today’s DBMS
	most often implemented database model. 
	It defines a database as a collection of tables 
	(relations) which contain all data. 
	This module deals predominantly with the relational database model 
	and the database systems based on it.

# Object Oriented model

	Object-oriented models define a database 
	as a collection of objects with features and methods.

# Network Model and Hierarchical Model:

	The network model and the hierarchical model are 
	the predecessors of the relational model.
	They build upon individual data sets 
	and are able to express hierarchical or network
	like structures of the real world.

# Object-relational Model

	Object-oriented models are very powerful but also quite complex. 
	With the relatively new object-relational
	database model is the wide spread and simple relational database model 
	extended by some basic object-oriented concepts. 
	These allow us to work with the widely know relational database model
	but also have some advantages of the object-oriented model without its complexity.
