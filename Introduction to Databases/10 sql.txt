# SQL 
	Structured Query Language is a special-purpose programming language designed for managing data held in a relational database
	management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS).
	Originally based upon relational algebra and tuple relational calculus, 
	SQL consists of a data definition language and a data manipulation language. 
	The scope of SQL includes data insert, query, update and delete, schema creation and modification, and data access control. 
	Although SQL is often described as, and to a great extent is, a declarative language (4GL), 
	it also includes procedural elements.

#Simple SQL query:

	SELECT Book.title AS Title,
       	       COUNT(*) AS Authors
 	 FROM  Book
	 JOIN  Book_author
	   ON  Book.isbn = Book_author.isbn
	 GROUP BY Book.title;
